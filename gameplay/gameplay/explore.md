  Exploration mode is all about cleaning the planet while discovering Items and
  NFTs.

# Explore

The goal of Exploration mode is to collect as much garbage as possible before it pollutes the environment even further. The first player who successfully clears a zone of the map can claim control over that area through a [Transmuter](../resources/#transmuter). Most of the garbage can be turned into valuable resources and be reutilized to progress in the game. There are two different classes of resources: NFTs and Game items. Eggs, Trash Items, Transmuters and Badges are all NFTs that can be either **** used in the game or traded in the Marketplace. Candies and Cartridges belong to the Game items categories and are extremely useful in the game, but cannot be exchanged elsewhere. Both NFTs and Game items can be found within Trash Bags. Players will have to spot and clear Trash Bags on the map in order to capture their content. Learn more about each [Resource](../resources/) on the relative page.

Once players have collected enough resources, they can generate a garble by means of a Transmuter. Transmuters can be bought and positioned on the map by their owners. Check out how the [Transmutations](transmutation.md) process work.

With three garbles, players can take part in Raids, time-based missions to clean the territory and obtain rewards. Raids opportunities are monitored on the map. Learn more about [Raids](raid.md) dynamics.&#x20;
