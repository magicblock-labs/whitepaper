# C02 tokens

**What are carbon credits?**&#x20;

> A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit a set amount of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas.

**What are C02 tokens?**

C02 tokens are simply an on-chain representation of traditional carbon credits. There are a few projects that tokenize carbon credits from trusted off-chain registries, the leading ones being [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/) and [Moss](https://moss.earth/).  Carbon assets on-chain can trade in a non-fungible, semi-fungible or fungible fashion like $BCT (Base Carbon Tonne). You can read more about carbon tokens here.

**What role do C02 tokens play in Garbles?**\
****More demand for carbon credits translates into higher incentives for companies to embrace carbon negative/neutral activities for the increased cost in off-setting. Garbles aims to foster the development of the on-chain carbon credit market through an accumulation mechanics baked into the game. Whenever players transmute garbage into garbles, they are required to burn their NFT trash items and $NUCLEAR, the game currency. A portion of this tx is used to acquire carbon tokens in the open market. Carbon tokens are then sent to the treasury so that they are effectively removed from circulation. Governance can decide how to make use of these resources, either by generating additional income streams (i.e. money market/KlimaDAO etc.) or by retiring them.&#x20;
