We want to make Garbles as easy as possible even if you don't know anything about blockchains! Just for the initial beta version, you will need a tiny bit of crypto knowledge i.e. what is a wallet. That's it! We will guide you on how to create a wallet once you sign up for the first time and you can immediately start collecting trash!

<summary>Do I have to pay to play Garbles?</summary>

You can start playing Garbles without spending any money! To make the most out of the game though, you will need a small amount of SOL to get a [transmuter](../gameplay/resources/nft/transmuters.md) or mint the [NFT](../gameplay/resources/nft/) that you find around. You can either transfer SOL to your game wallet or use the upcoming credit card integrations if you don't own any crypto outside of the game.&#x20;
